what data do i need to track in this app?


variables - userChoice, computerChoice
(purpose of variables (purpose of user choice and computer choice variables is to check if user won, loss or tied - if statement) is to check if user won, loss, or tie - ***if statement***)

play again (store true or false)
need to cherck the userChoice vs the computerChoice to determine how to update 

increment variables by 1? i++

wins ++ losses 
++
ties ++


when user choices a choice i need the computers random choice then compare the two choices to determine who won and update the value of the variables accordinyl 

how do i choose a random value for the computer?

determining who wins --> if statement

choose one path either user or computer

if you know a user chose something - you can decide if they win

compare users choice against random computer
math.floor
math.random
